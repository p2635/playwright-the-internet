# playwright-the-internet

This is my playground to practise playwright against https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet (The Internet 0.58.0). I used the Docker version of that repo when writing tests locally.

## What is 'The internet'?

This website is created by SauceLabs:

> An example application that captures prominent and ugly functionality found on the web. Perfect for writing automated acceptance tests against.

The page consists of one home page which is a list of links. Each link goes to a subpage which demonstrates the behaviour e.g. A/B testing, Basic Auth, Broken Images.
